Realistic Draw Scenarios in Xiangqi

This demo shows realistic scenarios around draw claims and player decisions:
1. When players would/wouldn't claim draws
2. The difference between forced draws (perpetual patterns) and optional draws
3. Strategic considerations in claiming draws

üü¢ Fifty-Move Rule ‚Üí Player can claim draw (if implemented)
üü¢ Mutual Agreement ‚Üí Both players agree to draw

TOURNAMENT PLAY:
‚úÖ Valid threefold repetition claims cannot be refused
‚úÖ Arbiter validates the claim using game notation
‚úÖ Players must follow official rules strictly
‚úÖ Draw offers can be made but opponent can decline
‚úÖ Time pressure affects draw decisions
‚úÖ Tournament standings influence draw acceptability

CASUAL PLAY:
ü§ù Players might negotiate draws more freely
ü§ù Less strict about exact rule interpretation
ü§ù Players might agree to draws by mutual consent
ü§ù More flexibility in house rules
ü§ù Less pressure to claim technical draws

ONLINE PLAY:
üíª Engine automatically validates repetition claims
üíª Draw offers sent through interface
üíª Opponent gets notification and can accept/decline
üíª Some platforms auto-draw on clear repetitions
üíª Time controls affect draw strategy

KEY TAKEAWAYS:

1. PLAYER PSYCHOLOGY MATTERS:
   - Players rarely claim draws when winning
   - Claims often come from worse positions
   - Experience affects draw timing decisions

2. CONTEXT IS CRUCIAL:
   - Tournament vs casual play
   - Time pressure situations
   - Standings and tournament needs

3. RULE IMPLEMENTATION:
   - Perpetual patterns: Automatic resolution
   - Regular repetition: Player choice required
   - Valid claims cannot be refused in tournament play

4. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Material advantage affects decisions
   - Time management plays a role
   - Opponent strength influences choices

The claim-based system respects traditional chess/Xiangqi rules while
giving players the strategic control they need to make informed decisions.
