Demonstration of the Official Elephant Chess Perpetual Check/Chase Rules Implementation

This file demonstrates the comprehensive implementation of perpetual check and chase rules
according to official Elephant Chess regulations, replacing the simple threefold repetition rule.

The implementation follows these official rules:
1. Perpetual Check: If a player gives perpetual check, they lose
2. Perpetual Chase: If a player gives perpetual chase, they lose  
3. Mutual Perpetual Check: If both players give perpetual check, it's a draw
4. Check vs Chase: If one gives perpetual check and other gives perpetual chase, the chaser loses
5. Regular Repetition: Simple threefold repetition without check/chase is a draw

RULE HIERARCHY (checked in this order):

1. MUTUAL PERPETUAL CHECK
   - Both players give perpetual check
   - Result: DRAW
   - Reason: Neither player can be blamed

2. CHECK vs CHASE  
   - One player gives perpetual check, other gives perpetual chase
   - Result: CHASING PLAYER LOSES
   - Reason: Check takes precedence over chase

3. PERPETUAL CHECK
   - One player continuously gives check with repetition
   - Result: CHECKING PLAYER LOSES  
   - Reason: Checking is considered aggressive/forcing

4. PERPETUAL CHASE
   - One player continuously threatens pieces of equal/greater value
   - Result: CHASING PLAYER LOSES
   - Reason: Chasing is considered aggressive/forcing

5. REGULAR REPETITION
   - Threefold repetition without check or chase
   - Result: DRAW
   - Reason: Neutral repetition

6. CHECKMATE/STALEMATE
   - Standard game ending conditions

âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES:

1. Enhanced Position Tracking:
   - Position sequence recording
   - Move sequence with player tracking
   - Detailed repetition counting

2. Perpetual Check Detection:
   - Identifies continuous checking patterns
   - Tracks checking player consistently
   - Requires 3+ position repetitions

3. Perpetual Chase Detection:  
   - Identifies threatening patterns
   - Uses piece value comparison
   - Tracks consistent chasing behavior

4. Rule Priority System:
   - Mutual perpetual check â†’ Draw
   - Check vs chase â†’ Chaser loses
   - Perpetual check â†’ Checker loses
   - Perpetual chase â†’ Chaser loses
   - Regular repetition â†’ Draw

5. Integration with Game Engine:
   - Seamless integration with existing game logic
   - Proper move validation
   - Enhanced game over detection

ðŸŽ¯ The implementation now follows official Elephant Chess regulations for
   perpetual check and chase, providing a much more authentic and
   competitive game experience than simple threefold repetition.
