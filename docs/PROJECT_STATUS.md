# ElephantFormer Project Status Summary

## 🎯 **Project Overview**
ElephantFormer is a Transformer-based AI system for playing Elephant Chess (Chinese Chess/Xiangqi) with comprehensive game analysis capabilities.

## ✅ **Completed Features**

### Core Game Engine
- **Fully functional Elephant Chess engine** with all piece movement rules
- **Official perpetual check/chase rules** implementation
- **Claim-based threefold repetition** (traditional chess rules)
- **Flying General rule** (kings cannot face each other)
- **Complete rule validation** and game state management

### AI Model
- **Transformer-based move prediction** model
- **Tokenized move representation** (fx, fy, tx, ty)
- **PyTorch Lightning training framework**
- **Model checkpoints** with best validation loss: 6.36
- **Multi-trial training** with resume capability

### Game Analysis System
- **Comprehensive game playback analyzer** with model confidence scoring
- **Move-by-move analysis** with top-k predictions
- **Interactive game replay** with step-by-step visualization
- **Move highlighting** with `+` (from) and `*` (to) position indicators
- **Pattern analysis** across multiple games
- **Win/loss/draw performance metrics**

### Data Pipeline
- **ICCS format parser** for game records
- **Tokenization utilities** for move sequences
- **Dataset creation** with train/val/test splits
- **Sequence length analysis** tools

### Evaluation Framework
- **Win rate calculation** against random opponents
- **Model accuracy metrics** on test datasets
- **Perplexity evaluation** for model confidence
- **Interactive gameplay** interface

## 🏆 **Key Achievements**

### 1. Advanced Rule Implementation
- Implemented official Elephant Chess perpetual check/chase rules
- Traditional claim-based draw system (not automatic)
- Comprehensive position tracking and repetition detection

### 2. Game Analysis Innovation
- **Restored move highlighting** feature for visual game replay
- Model confidence scoring for each move prediction
- Top-k prediction analysis with accuracy tracking
- Interactive step-by-step game review

### 3. Model Training Success
- Successfully trained transformer models to validation loss of 6.36
- Multiple training trials with checkpointing and resume capability
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Well-organized modular codebase
- Comprehensive documentation
- Demonstration scripts and test coverage
- Professional project structure
