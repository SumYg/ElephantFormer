# Move Highlighting Feature - RESTORED ✅

## Issue Fixed
The board visualization feature that shows piece movement with visual indicators had disappeared from the game replay system. Previously, when displaying board positions after moves, the system would show:
- `+` symbol at the position where a piece moved FROM 
- `*` symbol at the position where a piece moved TO

## Root Cause
In the `GameReplay.replay_game()` method in `elephant_former/analysis/game_playback.py`, the board was being displayed without passing the `last_move` parameter:

```python
# BEFORE (broken)
print(game)  # No move highlighting
```

## Solution
Updated the replay system to properly pass the `last_move` parameter when displaying board positions:

```python
# AFTER (fixed)  
print(game.__str__(last_move=move_analysis.actual_move))  # Shows move highlighting
```

## What This Enables
1. **Visual Move Tracking**: Users can easily see which move was just played
2. **Better Game Analysis**: Clear indication of piece movement during replay
3. **Enhanced Learning**: Visual feedback helps understand game flow
4. **Debugging Aid**: Move validation becomes easier with visual confirmation

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the feature works:
- `test_move_highlighting.py` - Basic functionality test
- `quick_replay_demo.py` - Integration test with game replay system

## Example Output
```
Board after move (WITH highlighting):
  +------------------+

0 | + 傌 相 仕 帥 仕 相 傌 俥 |
  +------------------+
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (x)
Current player: BLACK
```

The `+` shows where the piece came from, and the `*` shows where it moved to.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
The move highlighting feature is now fully restored and working in the game replay system.
