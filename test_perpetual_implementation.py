Test file for the enhanced perpetual check/chase detection in ElephantChessGame.

This file demonstrates the implementation of the official Elephant Chess perpetual check/chase rules:
1. Perpetual check - the checking player loses
2. Perpetual chase - the chasing player loses  
3. Mutual perpetual check - draw
4. Check vs chase - the chasing player loses
5. Regular threefold repetition - draw
