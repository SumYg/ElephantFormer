Demonstration of Claim-Based vs Automatic Threefold Repetition

This file shows the difference between:
1. Automatic threefold repetition (old system)
2. Claim-based threefold repetition (traditional system)

In traditional chess/Elephant Chess rules:
- Threefold repetition allows a player to CLAIM a draw
- The game doesn't end automatically
- Players can choose to continue playing even with repetitions

The updated implementation now distinguishes between:

1. PERPETUAL PATTERNS ‚Üí Automatic resolution (official rules)
   - Perpetual check: Checking player loses
   - Perpetual chase: Chasing player loses
   - Mutual perpetual: Draw
   - Check vs chase: Chasing player loses

2. REGULAR REPETITION ‚Üí Claim-based (traditional rules)
   - Players can choose to claim draw when eligible
   - Game continues unless draw is explicitly claimed   - Follows traditional chess/Elephant Chess behavior

This provides the best of both worlds:
- Official regulation enforcement for unfair perpetual patterns
- Traditional player choice for normal repetitions
