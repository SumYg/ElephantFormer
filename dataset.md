Here are some good sources for Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) game datasets you can use for your project:

1. **GitHub: CGLemon/chinese-chess-PGN**
   - This repository collects a large number of Xiangqi games in ICCS format (a coordinate-based notation, easy to parse for AI).
   - Over 140,000 games are available.
   - Download links (from the repo's README):
     - [World Xiangqi Federation games (41,743 games, ICCS format)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NScafJyq3qVG7HO77U_4rVQJxbyRKe0O?usp=sharing)
     - [Dongping Xiangqi games (99,813 games, ICCS format)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12Js9Ld6Yixq4RA96j1PeT2QTUJ0-z0OB?usp=sharing)
   - GitHub repo: [https://github.com/CGLemon/chinese-chess-PGN](https://github.com/CGLemon/chinese-chess-PGN)

2. **Xiangqi Cloud Database**
   - Online query and download interface for Xiangqi games.
   - [https://chessdb.cn/query_en/](https://chessdb.cn/query_en/)

3. **01xq.com**
   - A large online Xiangqi database with recent and historical games.

**Recommended for you:**  
The GitHub repo (CGLemon/chinese-chess-PGN) is the easiest to start with, as it provides direct download links and the ICCS format is well-documented and structured for parsing.

**Next Steps:**
- Download one of the ICCS datasets from the GitHub repo above.
- Let me know when you have a sample file, and I can help you write a parser to convert ICCS moves into your (fx, fy, tx, ty) format for tokenization.

Would you like instructions on how to download from Google Drive, or help with ICCS parsing once you have a file?
